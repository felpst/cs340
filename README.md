# cs340 - Project 2

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

It is first important to be able to understand and differentiate between the different domains that are part of the problem and the solution. Then to understand what are the relationship between all the domains, and from there I usually start to list all the requirements that are necessary to ensure those relationships. When coding I follow the clean code principles, which helps to establish a minimum quality to the software. I also follow a test driven development approach, to ensure a better final quality to the overall program.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The approach to a problem as a computer scientist happens first by truly understanding what a computer is capable of doing, then by understanding how to translate the requirements of possible solutions to a problem to software. To the project requested by Grazioso Salvare the process was the same. While developing the software I was introduced to new technologies, such as mongoDB and the dash framework, that accelerated the development process and increase the overall efficiency of the program. For my next projects I am going to use search for technologies such the ones I have mentioned previously, to improve the development speed. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientitst are professionals that have as their primary focus to validate and develop models for interaction between people and computers or software and devices, and that helps companies to improve their producvity.
